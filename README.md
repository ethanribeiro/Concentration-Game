# Ribeiro's Concentration Game 

## About:
#### This is a *Ribeiro* original "retro-styled" coded game using the JS (JavaScript) <br /> framework and utilizing HTML and CSS markup language. The objective of the game is to find and compare 2 cards, in a total of 30 cards, and have both cards be a matching pair. Thus completing the board of cards until all cards have been discovered with a matching pair after each turn. In turn, the game primarily utilizes the players concentration, ability to allocate and memorize patterns, shapes and form strategies.
